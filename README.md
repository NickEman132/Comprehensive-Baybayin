# [WIP] Comprehensive Baybayin―A free and modern guide for using *baybayin*.
*by NickEman132*

This document aims to provide a comprehensive aid for learning the modern *baybayin*.
Baybayin is a writing system used by the Tagalogs before the colonial era. Many variants and its sister scripts continued to be documented by the Spaniards, leaving us with knowledge of the past. Various groups and communities from around the world are reviving the use of this script.
The documentation will pinpoint specific topics and problems commonly encountered in using *baybayin*.

## how to read the document
- Throughout this document, I will use
  - `C` to represent a [*non-affricate consonant*](https://github.com/nickeman132i#consonants) in Tagalog. 
  - `V` to represent a [*monophthong vowel*](https://github.com/nickeman132i#vowels) in Tagalog.
  - `E` to represent a vague i-ay sound
  - `O` to represent a vague u-aw sound
  - `<reg>` to represent a phonemic [*regional or foreign consonant*](https://github.com/nickeman132i#foreign-consonants) in Tagalog. 
  - `y` or `w` to represent a [*semi-vowel*](https://github.com/nickeman132i#consonants) in Tagalog. 
  - `ŋ` to represent the Tagalog `ng` sound.
  - `-` to represent the glottal stop or the Tagalog `-` or `'` sound.

## general principles
When using *baybayin*, keep in mind of these general principles.

### language
*Baybayin* as being taught here, is used for Tagalog only.
However, nothing or no one should stop you from using it for another language.
There are several scripts that are used in major languages of the Philippines; it's recommended you learn its respective script.
Among these scripts are Kulitan, Surat Mangyan (Buhid, Hanunó'o), and Palawano (Tagbanwa, Ibalnan).

### not an alphabet
*Baybayin* is not an alphabet, but an abugida or an alphasyllabary.
Each character represents a mora: a consonant and a vowel or `CV`.
In writing the word `mama`, you would write it with two `ma` characters.

### getting a tattoo
Do not use *Baybayin* for getting yourself tattooed before learning about it.
make sure you read this guide and know what you're getting tattooed on your skin.

# common core
There are 14 common morae and 3 vowel-based morae in baybayin.
In order, they are: `ᜃ ᜄ ᜅ ᜆ ᜇ ᜈ ᜉ ᜊ ᜋ ᜌ ᜎ ᜏ ᜐ ᜑ` and `ᜀ ᜁ ᜂ`.
The common morae all end in the vowel `a` by default, or is `Ca`.
The vowel-based morae end in `-a`, `-E` and `-O` respectively.
